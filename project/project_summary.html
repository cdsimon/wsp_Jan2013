<h1>San Diego Bontanic Garden</h1>
<h2>Site Intent</h2>
<a>The overall intent of redesigning this site is to make better use of space and condense
the site to for better usability.  According to the demographics and users of this site the content
should be of interest to not only the adult user but children friendly content as well. The
San Diego Bontic Garden has a lot of information that could possibly be condensed to less pages
but I think that the main issue with this redesign is to make better use of the space and
user readability making sure that bread crumbs are presents to bring the user back to the
central information of the site.</a>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<a>According to Alexa.com, the competition for San Diego Bontanic Gardens is BontanicWonders.com.
The competition appears to be getting about 5,000,000 more hits that SDBG.  Also looking at the
keyword search; the search for dioon angustifolium is the main keyword driving the customer to this
site. The Dioon plant is a cold hardy cycad plant this is known to grown in dry shade in exposed skeletal
sails.  Especially in drought conditions, this plant is known to withstand harsh conditions.  I think
another advantage BontnicWonders.com has over SDBG is the fact that they have a web site store online
that you can actually purchase certain products for sale.  BontnicWonders.com does not sell a lot of
various plants online but it couldn't hurt SDBG to offer a few select plants to sell online as well.
I think BotanicWonders.com is drawing their demographics from gardeners primiarly.

<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
One of the advantages that SDBG has over BotanicWonders.com is that they target children as part of
their audience and it might be a good thing to bring that feature out a little more on the home page.
Also, SDBG's gala section should be one of the things that draws more attention to their site.  It could
also be a good idea to draw more attention to both the chidren's section as well as the wedding/ritual
section of the site. People tend pay more attention someplace they can interact with. Since the SDBG also
holds classes; highlighting on up coming classes might help.

As far as videos go; quite a few of the videos on the site are slow to load and they drag once
they start to play.

This client actually has three types of user that we can put in two categories.  One group is the
family.  Parents/children.  Parents and enjoy the magic of the gardens, while watching their children
interact and learn or the adults can have their sperate time together while the children are enjoying
classes of their own.  The other group would be the users that hold functions such as weddings,
rituals or social gatherings. These people can utilize the beauty of the gardens and generate a word
of mouth reference from a positive social event.
